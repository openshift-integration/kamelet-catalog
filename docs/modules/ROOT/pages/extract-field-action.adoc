= image:kamelets/extract-field-action.svg[] Extract Field Action

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Extract a field from the message body.

The extract field action expects an application/json content type.

The field parameter allows you to specify which field of the json the user wants to extract. By default the message body will be overriden with the extracted field.

The optional parameter headerOutput allows the user to specify wheter the extracted field should be stored in a message header named 'CamelKameletsExtractFieldName', leaving the message body untouched.

The optional parameter headerOutputName allows the user to specify a custom header name instead of the default 'CamelKameletsExtractFieldName'. This parameter must be used in conjunction with headerOutput.
If no headerOutputName parameter will be provided, the default 'CamelKameletsExtractFieldName' will be used.

The optional parameter strictHeaderCheck allows to user to enable a strict header name check. If enabled the action will check if the header output name (custom or default) has been used already in the     exchange. If so, the extracted field will be stored in the message body, if not, the extracted field will be stored in the selected header (custom or default).

The headerOutput/headerOutputName/strictHeaderCheck parameters are particulary useful in case you would like to reuse an extracted field as parameter for another header, for example.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `extract-field-action` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *field {empty}* *| Field| The name of the field to extract| string| | 
| headerOutput| Header Output| If enable the action will store the extracted field in an header named CamelKameletsExtractFieldName| boolean| `false`| 
| headerOutputName| Header Output Name| A custom name for the header containing the extracted field| string| `"none"`| 
| strictHeaderCheck| Strict Header Check| If enabled the action will check if the header output name (custom or default) has been used already in the exchange. If so, the extracted field will be stored in the message body, if not, the extracted field will be stored in the selected header (custom or default).| boolean| `false`| 
| trimField| Trim Field| If enabled we return the Raw extracted field| boolean| `false`| 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with an asterisk ({empty}*) are mandatory.

- camel:core
- camel:jackson 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `extract-field-action`.

=== Knative Action

You can use the `extract-field-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.extract-field-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: extract-field-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: extract-field-action
    properties:
      field: "The Field"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel

----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `extract-field-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f extract-field-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step extract-field-action -p "step-0.field=The Field" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

You can use the `extract-field-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.extract-field-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: extract-field-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: extract-field-action
    properties:
      field: "The Field"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `extract-field-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f extract-field-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step extract-field-action -p "step-0.field=The Field" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
