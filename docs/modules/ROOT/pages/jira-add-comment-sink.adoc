= image:kamelets/jira-add-comment-sink.svg[] Jira Add Comment Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Add a new comment to an existing issue in Jira.

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `issueKey` / `ce-issueKey`: as the issue code.

The comment is set in the body of the message.

To authenticate a username/password or personal token must be defined. We recommend to use personal token as it is a safer way to get access to Jira.
