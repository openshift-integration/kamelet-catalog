= image:kamelets/aws-sqs-source.svg[] AWS SQS Source

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Receive data from AWS SQS.

Access Key/Secret Key are the basic method for authenticating to the AWS SQS Service. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides the 'useDefaultCredentialsProvider'.

When using a default Credentials Provider the SQS client will load the credentials through this provider and won't use the static credential. This is reason for not having the access key and secret key as mandatory parameter for this Kamelet.

Two headers will be duplicated with different names for clarity at sink level, CamelAwsSqsMessageId will be duplicated into aws.sqs.message.id and CamelAwsSqsReceiptHandle will be duplicated in aws.sqs.receipt.handle

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-sqs-source` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *queueNameOrArn {empty}* *| Queue Name| The SQS Queue Name or ARN| string| | 
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to access.| string| | 
| accessKey| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| amazonAWSHost| AWS Host| The hostname of the Amazon AWS cloud.| string| `"amazonaws.com"`| 
| autoCreateQueue| Autocreate Queue| Setting the autocreation of the SQS queue.| boolean| `false`| 
| delay| Delay| The number of milliseconds before the next poll of the selected stream| integer| `500`| 
| deleteAfterRead| Auto-delete Messages| Delete messages after consuming them| boolean| `true`| 
| greedy| Greedy Scheduler| If greedy is enabled, then the polling will happen immediately again, if the previous run polled 1 or more messages.| boolean| `false`| 
| overrideEndpoint| Endpoint Overwrite| Select this option to override the endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also provide a URI for the `uriEndpointOverride` option.| boolean| `false`| 
| protocol| Protocol| The underlying protocol used to communicate with SQS| string| `"https"`| `"http or https"`
| queueURL| Queue URL| The full SQS Queue URL (required if using KEDA)| string| | 
| secretKey| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| uriEndpointOverride| Overwrite Endpoint URI| The overriding endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also select the `overrideEndpoint` option.| string| | 
| useDefaultCredentialsProvider| Default Credentials Provider| If true, the SQS client loads credentials through a default credentials provider. If false, it uses the basic authentication method (access key and secret key).| boolean| `false`|

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-sqs-source` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:core
- camel:aws2-sqs
- github:openshift-integration.kamelet-catalog:camel-kamelets-utils:2.2.0-SNAPSHOT
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-sqs-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `aws-sqs-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-sqs-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-sqs-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-sqs-source
    properties:
      queueNameOrArn: "The Queue Name"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-sqs-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-sqs-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind aws-sqs-source -p "source.queueNameOrArn=The Queue Name" -p "source.region=The AWS Region" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `aws-sqs-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-sqs-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-sqs-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-sqs-source
    properties:
      queueNameOrArn: "The Queue Name"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-sqs-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-sqs-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind aws-sqs-source -p "source.queueNameOrArn=The Queue Name" -p "source.region=The AWS Region" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
