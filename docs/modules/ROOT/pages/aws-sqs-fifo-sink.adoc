= image:kamelets/aws-sqs-fifo-sink.svg[] AWS SQS FIFO Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*


Send message to an AWS SQS FIFO Queue.

Access Key/Secret Key are the basic method for authenticating to the AWS SQS Service. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides the 'useDefaultCredentialsProvider'.

When using a default Credentials Provider the SQS client will load the credentials through this provider and won't use the static credential. This is reason for not having the access key and secret key as mandatory parameter for this Kamelet.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *queueNameOrArn {empty}* *| Queue Name| The SQS Queue name or ARN| string| | 
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to access.| string| | 
| accessKey| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| amazonAWSHost| AWS Host| The hostname of the Amazon AWS cloud.| string| `"amazonaws.com"`| 
| autoCreateQueue| Autocreate Queue| Setting the autocreation of the SQS queue.| boolean| `false`| 
| contentBasedDeduplication| Content-Based Deduplication| Use content-based deduplication (should be enabled in the SQS FIFO queue first)| boolean| `false`| 
| overrideEndpoint| Endpoint Overwrite| Select this option to override the endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also provide a URI for the `uriEndpointOverride` option.| boolean| `false`| 
| protocol| Protocol| The underlying protocol used to communicate with SQS| string| `"https"`| `"http or https"`
| secretKey| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| uriEndpointOverride| Overwrite Endpoint URI| The overriding endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also select the `overrideEndpoint` option.| string| | 
| useDefaultCredentialsProvider| Default Credentials Provider| Set whether the SQS client should expect to load credentials through a default credentials provider or to expect static credentials to be passed in.| boolean| `false`| 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with an asterisk ({empty}*) are mandatory.


== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:aws2-sqs
- camel:core
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-sqs-fifo-sink
    properties:
      queueNameOrArn: "The Queue Name"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-sqs-fifo-sink -p "sink.queueNameOrArn=The Queue Name" -p "sink.region=The AWS Region"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-sqs-fifo-sink
    properties:
      queueNameOrArn: "The Queue Name"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-sqs-fifo-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic aws-sqs-fifo-sink -p "sink.queueNameOrArn=The Queue Name" -p "sink.region=The AWS Region"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
