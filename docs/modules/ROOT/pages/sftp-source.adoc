== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `sftp-source` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *connectionHost {empty}* *| Connection Host| The hostname of the SFTP server.| string| | 
| *connectionPort {empty}* *| Connection Port| The port of the FTP server.| string| `22`| 
| *directoryName {empty}* *| Directory Name| The starting directory.| string| | 
| autoCreate| Autocreate Missing Directories| Automatically create starting directory.| boolean| `true`| 
| binary| Binary| Specifies the file transfer mode, BINARY or ASCII. Default is ASCII (false).| boolean| `false`| 
| delete| Delete| If true, the file will be deleted after it is processed successfully.| boolean| `false`| 
| idempotent| Idempotency| Skip already-processed files.| boolean| `true`| 
| ignoreFileNotFoundOrPermissionError| Ignore File Not Found Or Permission Error| Whether to ignore when (trying to list files in directories or when downloading a file), which does not exist or due to permission error. By default when a directory or file does not exists or insufficient permission, then an exception is thrown. Setting this option to true allows to ignore that instead.| boolean| `false`| 
| passiveMode| Passive Mode| Sets the passive mode connection.| boolean| `false`| 
| password| Password| The password to access the SFTP server.| string| | 
| privateKeyFile| Private Key File| Set the private key file so that the SFTP endpoint can do private key verification.| string| | 
| privateKeyPassphrase| Private Key Passphrase| Set the private key file passphrase so that the SFTP endpoint can do private key verification.| string| | 
| privateKeyUri| Private Key URI| Set the private key file (loaded from classpath by default) so that the SFTP endpoint can do private key verification.| string| | 
| recursive| Recursive| If a directory, look for files in all sub-directories as well.| boolean| `false`| 
| strictHostKeyChecking| Strict Host Checking| Sets whether to use strict host key checking.| string| `false`| 
| useUserKnownHostsFile| Use User Known Hosts File| If knownHostFile has not been explicit configured then use the host file from System.getProperty(user.home)/.ssh/known_hosts.| boolean| `true`| 
| username| Username| The username to access the SFTP server.| string| |

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `sftp-source` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:ftp
- camel:core
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `sftp-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `sftp-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.sftp-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: sftp-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: sftp-source
    properties:
      connectionHost: "The Connection Host"
      directoryName: "The Directory Name"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `sftp-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f sftp-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind sftp-source -p "source.connectionHost=The Connection Host" -p "source.directoryName=The Directory Name" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `sftp-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.sftp-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: sftp-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: sftp-source
    properties:
      connectionHost: "The Connection Host"
      directoryName: "The Directory Name"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `sftp-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f sftp-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind sftp-source -p "source.connectionHost=The Connection Host" -p "source.directoryName=The Directory Name" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
