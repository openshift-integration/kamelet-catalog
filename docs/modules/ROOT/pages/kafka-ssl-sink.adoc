*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send data to Kafka topics wit TLS/SSL support.

The Kamelet is able to understand the following headers to be set:

- `key` / `ce-key`: as message key

- `partition-key` / `ce-partitionkey`: as message partition key

Both the headers are optional.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `kafka-ssl-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *bootstrapServers {empty}* *| Brokers| Comma separated list of Kafka Broker URLs| string| | 
| *sslKeyPassword {empty}* *| SSL Key Password| The password of the private key in the key store file.| string| | 
| *sslKeystoreLocation {empty}* *| SSL Keystore Location| The location of the key store file. This is optional for client and can be used for two-way authentication for client.| string| | 
| *sslKeystorePassword {empty}* *| SSL Keystore Password| The store password for the key store file.This is optional for client and only needed if ssl.keystore.location is configured.| string| | 
| *sslTruststoreLocation {empty}* *| SSL Truststore Location| The location of the trust store file.| string| | 
| *topic {empty}* *| Topic Names| Comma separated list of Kafka topic names| string| | 
| saslMechanism| SASL Mechanism| The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Mechanism used.| string| `"GSSAPI"`| 
| securityProtocol| Security Protocol| Protocol used to communicate with brokers. SASL_PLAINTEXT, PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL and SSL are supported| string| `"SSL"`| 
| sslEnabledProtocols| SSL Enabled Protocols| The list of protocols enabled for SSL connections. TLSv1.2, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1 are enabled by default.| string| `"TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1,TLSv1"`| 
| sslProtocol| SSL Protocol| The SSL protocol used to generate the SSLContext. Default setting is TLS, which is fine for most cases. Allowed values in recent JVMs are TLS, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. SSL, SSLv2 and SSLv3 may be supported in older JVMs, but their usage is discouraged due to known security vulnerabilities.| string| `"TLSv1.2"`|

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `kafka-ssl-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:core
- camel:kafka
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `kafka-ssl-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `kafka-ssl-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.kafka-ssl-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: kafka-ssl-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: kafka-ssl-sink
    properties:
      bootstrapServers: "The Brokers"
      sslKeyPassword: "The SSL Key Password"
      sslKeystoreLocation: "The SSL Keystore Location"
      sslKeystorePassword: "The SSL Keystore Password"
      sslTruststoreLocation: "The SSL Truststore Location"
      topic: "The Topic Names"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `kafka-ssl-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f kafka-ssl-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel kafka-ssl-sink -p "sink.bootstrapServers=The Brokers" -p "sink.sslKeyPassword=The SSL Key Password" -p "sink.sslKeystoreLocation=The SSL Keystore Location" -p "sink.sslKeystorePassword=The SSL Keystore Password" -p "sink.sslTruststoreLocation=The SSL Truststore Location" -p "sink.topic=The Topic Names"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `kafka-ssl-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.kafka-ssl-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: kafka-ssl-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: kafka-ssl-sink
    properties:
      bootstrapServers: "The Brokers"
      sslKeyPassword: "The SSL Key Password"
      sslKeystoreLocation: "The SSL Keystore Location"
      sslKeystorePassword: "The SSL Keystore Password"
      sslTruststoreLocation: "The SSL Truststore Location"
      topic: "The Topic Names"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `kafka-ssl-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f kafka-ssl-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic kafka-ssl-sink -p "sink.bootstrapServers=The Brokers" -p "sink.sslKeyPassword=The SSL Key Password" -p "sink.sslKeystoreLocation=The SSL Keystore Location" -p "sink.sslKeystorePassword=The SSL Keystore Password" -p "sink.sslTruststoreLocation=The SSL Truststore Location" -p "sink.topic=The Topic Names"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
