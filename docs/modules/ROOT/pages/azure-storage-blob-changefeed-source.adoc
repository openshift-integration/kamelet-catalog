.azure-storage-blob-changefeed-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-storage-blob-changefeed-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: azure-storage-blob-changefeed-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      accountName: "The Account Name"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
