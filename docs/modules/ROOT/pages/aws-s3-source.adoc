== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-s3-source` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:kamelet
- camel:aws2-s3 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-s3-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `aws-s3-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-s3-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-s3-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-s3-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      bucketNameOrArn: "The Bucket Name"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-s3-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-s3-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind aws-s3-source -p "source.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "source.bucketNameOrArn=The Bucket Name" -p "source.region=eu-west-1" -p "source.secretKey=The Secret Key" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `aws-s3-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-s3-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-s3-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: aws-s3-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      bucketNameOrArn: "The Bucket Name"
      region: "eu-west-1"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-s3-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-s3-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind aws-s3-source -p "source.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "source.bucketNameOrArn=The Bucket Name" -p "source.region=eu-west-1" -p "source.secretKey=The Secret Key" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
