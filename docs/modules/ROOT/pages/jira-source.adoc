== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `jira-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `jira-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.jira-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: jira-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: jira-source
    properties:
      jiraUrl: "http://my_jira.com:8081"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `jira-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f jira-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind jira-source -p "source.jiraUrl=http://my_jira.com:8081" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `jira-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.jira-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1

      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `jira-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f jira-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind jira-source -p "source.jiraUrl=http://my_jira.com:8081" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
