= image:kamelets/mongodb-source.svg[] MongoDB Source

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Consume data from MongoDB.

If you enable the `persistentTailTracking` property, the consumer keeps track of the last consumed message and, on the next restart, the consumption restarts from that message. If you enable `persistentTailTracking`, you must provide a value for the `tailTrackIncreasingField` property (by default it is optional).

If you disable the `persistentTailTracking` property, the consumer consumes the whole collection and waits in idle for new data to consume.

The collection that provides the data must be a capped collection.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `mongodb-source` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *collection {empty}* *| MongoDB Collection| The name of the MongoDB collection to bind to this endpoint.| string| | 
| *database {empty}* *| MongoDB Database| The name of the MongoDB database.| string| | 
| *hosts {empty}* *| MongoDB Hosts| A comma-separated list of MongoDB host addresses in `host:port` format.| string| | 
| password| MongoDB Password| The user password for accessing MongoDB.| string| | 
| persistentTailTracking| MongoDB Persistent Tail Tracking| Specifies to enable persistent tail tracking, which is a mechanism to keep track of the last consumed data across system restarts. The next time the system is up, the endpoint recovers the cursor from the point where it last stopped consuimg data. This option will only work on capped collections.| boolean| `false`| 
| ssl| Enable Ssl for Mongodb Connection| whether to enable ssl connection to mongodb| boolean| `true`| 
| sslValidationEnabled| Enables Ssl Certificates Validation and Host name checks.| IMPORTANT this should be disabled only in test environment since can pose security issues.| boolean| `true`| 
| tailTrackIncreasingField| MongoDB Tail Track Increasing Field| The correlation field in the incoming data which is of increasing nature and is used to position the tailing cursor every time it is generated.| string| | 
| username| MongoDB Username| The username for accessing MongoDB. The username must be present in the MongoDB's authentication database (`authenticationDatabase`). By default, the MongoDB `authenticationDatabase` is 'admin'.| string| | 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with an asterisk ({empty}*) are mandatory.


== Dependencies

At runtime, the `mongodb-source` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:kamelet
- camel:mongodb
- camel:jackson
- github:openshift-integration.kamelet-catalog:camel-kamelets-utils:2.2.0-SNAPSHOT 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `mongodb-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `mongodb-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.mongodb-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mongodb-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: mongodb-source
    properties:
      collection: "The MongoDB Collection"
      database: "The MongoDB Database"
      hosts: "The MongoDB Hosts"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `mongodb-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f mongodb-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind mongodb-source -p "source.collection=The MongoDB Collection" -p "source.database=The MongoDB Database" -p "source.hosts=The MongoDB Hosts" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `mongodb-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.mongodb-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: mongodb-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: mongodb-source
    properties:
      collection: "The MongoDB Collection"
      database: "The MongoDB Database"
      hosts: "The MongoDB Hosts"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `mongodb-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f mongodb-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind mongodb-source -p "source.collection=The MongoDB Collection" -p "source.database=The MongoDB Database" -p "source.hosts=The MongoDB Hosts" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
