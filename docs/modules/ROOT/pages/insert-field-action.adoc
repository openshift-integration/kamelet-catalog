= image:kamelets/insert-field-action.svg[] Insert Field Action

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Adds a custom field with a simple language parsed value to the message in transit.

The extract field action expected an application/json content type.

If for example you have an array like '{ "foo":"John", "bar":30 }' and your action has been configured with field as 'element' and value as 'hello', you'll get '{ "foo":"John", "bar":30, "element":"hello" }'

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `insert-field-action`.

=== Knative Action

You can use the `insert-field-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.insert-field-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: insert-field-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: '{"foo":"John"}'
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: json-deserialize-action
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: insert-field-action
    properties:
      field: "The Field"
      value: "The Value"
  sink:

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `insert-field-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f insert-field-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind --name insert-field-action-binding timer-source?message='{"foo":"John"}' --step json-deserialize-action --step insert-field-action -p step-1.field='The Field' -p step-1.value='The Value' channel:mychannel

----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

You can use the `insert-field-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.insert-field-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1

      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `insert-field-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
