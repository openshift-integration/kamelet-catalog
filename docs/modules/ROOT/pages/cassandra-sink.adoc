*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send data to an Apache Cassandra cluster.

This Kamelet expects JSON Array formatted data. The content of the JSON Array is used as input for the CQL Prepared Statement set in the query parameter.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `cassandra-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *connectionHost {empty}* *| Connection Host| The hostname(s) for the Cassandra server(s). Use a comma to separate multiple hostnames.| string| | `"localhost"`
| *connectionPort {empty}* *| Connection Port| The port number(s) of the cassandra server(s). Use a comma to separate multiple port numbers.| string| | `9042`
| *keyspace {empty}* *| Keyspace| The keyspace to use.| string| | `"customers"`
| *query {empty}* *| Query| The query to execute against the Cassandra cluster table.| string| | 
| consistencyLevel| Consistency Level| The consistency level to use.| string| `"ANY"`| 
| extraTypeCodecs| Extra Type Codecs| To use a specific comma separated list of Extra Type codecs.| string| | 
| password| Password| The password for accessing a secured Cassandra cluster.| string| | 
| prepareStatements| Prepare Statements| If true, specifies to use PreparedStatements as the query. If false, specifies to use regular Statements as the query.| boolean| `true`| 
| username| Username| The username for accessing a secured Cassandra cluster.| string| |

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `cassandra-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:jackson
- camel:kamelet
- camel:cassandraql 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `cassandra-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `cassandra-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.cassandra-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: cassandra-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: cassandra-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "localhost"
      connectionPort: 9042
      keyspace: "customers"
      query: "The Query"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `cassandra-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f cassandra-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel cassandra-sink -p "sink.connectionHost=localhost" -p sink.connectionPort=9042 -p "sink.keyspace=customers" -p "sink.query=The Query"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `cassandra-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.cassandra-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: cassandra-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: cassandra-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "localhost"
      connectionPort: 9042
      keyspace: "customers"
      query: "The Query"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `cassandra-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f cassandra-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic cassandra-sink -p "sink.connectionHost=localhost" -p sink.connectionPort=9042 -p "sink.keyspace=customers" -p "sink.query=The Query"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
