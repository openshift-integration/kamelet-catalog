= image:kamelets/jira-transition-issue-sink.svg[] Jira Transition Issue Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Sets a new status (transition to) of an existing issue in Jira.

The Kamelet expects the following headers to be set:

- `issueKey` / `ce-issueKey`: as the issue unique code.

- `issueTransitionId` / `ce-issueTransitionId`: as the new status (transition) code. You should carefully check the project workflow as each transition may have conditions to check before the transition is made.

The comment of the transition is set in the body of the message.

To authenticate a username/password or personal token must be defined. We recommend to use personal token as it is a safer way to get access to Jira.
