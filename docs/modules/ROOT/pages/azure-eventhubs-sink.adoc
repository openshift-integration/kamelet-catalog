*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send events to Azure Event Hubs.

The Kamelet checks for the `partition-id` / `ce-partition-id` header which is an identifier of the Event Hub partition that the event will be sent to. If the identifier is not specified, the Event Hubs service will be responsible for routing events that are sent to an available partition.
   
A header is optional. If the header is not set, the partition is assigned by Event Hubs.

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `azure-eventhubs-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `azure-eventhubs-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.azure-eventhubs-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-eventhubs-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: azure-eventhubs-sink
    properties:
      eventhubName: "The Eventhubs Name"
      namespaceName: "The Eventhubs Namespace"
      sharedAccessKey: "The Share Access Key"
      sharedAccessName: "The Share Access Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `azure-eventhubs-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f azure-eventhubs-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel azure-eventhubs-sink -p "sink.eventhubName=The Eventhubs Name" -p "sink.namespaceName=The Eventhubs Namespace" -p "sink.sharedAccessKey=The Share Access Key" -p "sink.sharedAccessName=The Share Access Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `azure-eventhubs-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.azure-eventhubs-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-eventhubs-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: azure-eventhubs-sink
    properties:
      eventhubName: "The Eventhubs Name"
      namespaceName: "The Eventhubs Namespace"
      sharedAccessKey: "The Share Access Key"
      sharedAccessName: "The Share Access Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `azure-eventhubs-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f azure-eventhubs-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic azure-eventhubs-sink -p "sink.eventhubName=The Eventhubs Name" -p "sink.namespaceName=The Eventhubs Namespace" -p "sink.sharedAccessKey=The Share Access Key" -p "sink.sharedAccessName=The Share Access Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
