.simple-filter-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: simple-filter-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `simple-filter-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f simple-filter-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step simple-filter-action -p "step-0.expression=The Simple Expression" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

You can use the `simple-filter-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.simple-filter-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: simple-filter-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1

  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `simple-filter-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f simple-filter-action-binding.yaml

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step simple-filter-action -p "step-0.expression=The Simple Expression" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
