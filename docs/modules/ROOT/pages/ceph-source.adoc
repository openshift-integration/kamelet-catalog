*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Receive data from an Ceph Bucket, managed by a Object Storage Gateway.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `ceph-source` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *accessKey {empty}* *| Access Key| The access key.| string| | 
| *bucketName {empty}* *| Bucket Name| The Ceph Bucket name.| string| | 
| *cephUrl {empty}* *| Ceph Url Address| Set the Ceph Object Storage Address Url.| string| | `"http://ceph-storage-address.com"`
| *secretKey {empty}* *| Secret Key| The secret key.| string| | 
| *zoneGroup {empty}* *| Bucket Zone Group| The bucket zone group.| string| | 
| autoCreateBucket| Autocreate Bucket| Specifies to automatically create the bucket.| boolean| `false`| 
| delay| Delay| The number of milliseconds before the next poll of the selected bucket.| integer| `500`| 
| deleteAfterRead| Auto-delete Objects| Specifies to delete objects after consuming them.| boolean| `true`| 
| ignoreBody| Ignore Body| If true, the Object body is ignored. Setting this to true overrides any behavior defined by the `includeBody` option. If false, the object is put in the body.| boolean| `false`| 
| includeBody| Include Body| If true, the exchange is consumed and put into the body and closed. If false, the Object stream is put raw into the body and the headers are set with the object metadata.| boolean| `true`| 
| prefix| Prefix| The bucket prefix to consider while searching.| string| | `"folder/"`

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `ceph-source` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:aws2-s3
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `ceph-source`.

=== Knative Source

You can use the `ceph-source` Kamelet as a Knative source by binding it to a Knative object.

.ceph-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: ceph-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: ceph-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      bucketName: "The Bucket Name"
      cephUrl: "http://ceph-storage-address.com"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      zoneGroup: "The Bucket Zone Group"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `ceph-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f ceph-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind ceph-source -p "source.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "source.bucketName=The Bucket Name" -p "source.cephUrl=http://ceph-storage-address.com" -p "source.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "source.zoneGroup=The Bucket Zone Group" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Source

You can use the `ceph-source` Kamelet as a Kafka source by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.ceph-source-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: ceph-source-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: ceph-source
    properties:
      accessKey: "The Access Key"
      bucketName: "The Bucket Name"
      cephUrl: "http://ceph-storage-address.com"
      secretKey: "The Secret Key"
      zoneGroup: "The Bucket Zone Group"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `ceph-source-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the source by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f ceph-source-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the source by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind ceph-source -p "source.accessKey=The Access Key" -p "source.bucketName=The Bucket Name" -p "source.cephUrl=http://ceph-storage-address.com" -p "source.secretKey=The Secret Key" -p "source.zoneGroup=The Bucket Zone Group" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
