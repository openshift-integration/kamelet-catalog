*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

A Kamelet that can produce events to an IBM MQ message queue using JMS.

In your KameletBinding file, you must explicitly declare the IBM MQ Server driver dependency in spec->integration->dependencies

- "mvn:com.ibm.mq:com.ibm.mq.allclient:<version>"

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `jms-ibm-mq-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:jms
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `jms-ibm-mq-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `jms-ibm-mq-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
    properties:
      serverName: "10.103.41.245"
      serverPort: "1414"
      destinationType: "queue"
      destinationName: "DEV.QUEUE.1"
      queueManager: QM1
      channel: DEV.APP.SVRCONN
      username: app
      password: passw0rd

----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind --name jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding timer-source?message="Hello IBM MQ!" 'jms-ibm-mq-sink?serverName=10.103.41.245&serverPort=1414&destinationType=queue&destinationName=DEV.QUEUE.1&queueManager=QM1&channel=DEV.APP.SVRCONN&username=app&password=passw0rd'

----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `jms-ibm-mq-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: jms-ibm-mq-sink
    properties:
      serverName: "10.103.41.245"
      serverPort: "1414"
      destinationType: "queue"
      destinationName: "DEV.QUEUE.1"
      queueManager: QM1
      channel: DEV.APP.SVRCONN
      username: app
      password: passw0rd

----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding.yaml

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind --name jms-ibm-mq-sink-binding timer-source?message="Hello IBM MQ!" 'jms-ibm-mq-sink?serverName=10.103.41.245&serverPort=1414&destinationType=queue&destinationName=DEV.QUEUE.1&queueManager=QM1&channel=DEV.APP.SVRCONN&username=app&password=passw0rd'
