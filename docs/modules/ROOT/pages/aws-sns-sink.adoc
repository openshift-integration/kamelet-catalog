= image:kamelets/aws-sns-sink.svg[] AWS SNS Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic.

The basic authentication method for the SNS service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.

If you use the default credentials provider, the SNS client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.

In the header, you can optionally set the `subject` / `ce-subject` property to specify the subject of the message.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-sns-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to access.| string| | 
| *topicNameOrArn {empty}* *| Topic Name| The SNS topic name name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN).| string| | 
| accessKey| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| autoCreateTopic| Autocreate Topic| Setting the autocreation of the SNS topic.| boolean| `false`| 
| overrideEndpoint| Endpoint Overwrite| Select this option to override the endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also provide a URI for the `uriEndpointOverride` option.| boolean| `false`| 
| secretKey| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| uriEndpointOverride| Overwrite Endpoint URI| The overriding endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also select the `overrideEndpoint` option.| string| | 
| useDefaultCredentialsProvider| Default Credentials Provider| If true, the SNS client loads credentials through a default credentials provider. If false, it uses the basic authentication method (access key and secret key).| boolean| `false`|

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-sns-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:core
- camel:aws2-sns
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-sns-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `aws-sns-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-sns-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-sns-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-sns-sink
    properties:
      region: "The AWS Region"
      topicNameOrArn: "The Topic Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-sns-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-sns-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-sns-sink -p "sink.region=The AWS Region" -p "sink.topicNameOrArn=The Topic Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `aws-sns-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-sns-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-sns-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-sns-sink
    properties:
      region: "The AWS Region"
      topicNameOrArn: "The Topic Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-sns-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-sns-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic aws-sns-sink -p "sink.region=The AWS Region" -p "sink.topicNameOrArn=The Topic Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
