==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `has-header-filter-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind --name has-header-filter-action-binding timer-source?message="Hello" --step insert-header-action -p "step-0.name=my-header" -p "step-0.value=my-value" --step has-header-filter-action -p "step-1.name=my-header" channel:mychannel

----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
