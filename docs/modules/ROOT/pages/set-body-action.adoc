apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: set-body-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `set-body-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f set-body-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step set-body-action -p "step-0.value=The Value" channel:mychannel
