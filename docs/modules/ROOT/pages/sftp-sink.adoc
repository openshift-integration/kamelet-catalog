= image:kamelets/sftp-sink.svg[] SFTP Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send data to an SFTP Server.

In the header, you can set the `file` / `ce-file` property to specify the filename to upload.

If you do not set the property in the header, the Kamelet uses the exchange ID for the filename.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `sftp-sink` Kamelet:

== Dependencies

At runtime, the `sftp-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:ftp
- camel:core
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `sftp-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `sftp-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.sftp-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: sftp-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: sftp-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "The Connection Host"
      directoryName: "The Directory Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `sftp-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f sftp-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel sftp-sink -p "sink.connectionHost=The Connection Host" -p "sink.directoryName=The Directory Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `sftp-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.sftp-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: sftp-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: sftp-sink
    properties:
      connectionHost: "The Connection Host"
      directoryName: "The Directory Name"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `sftp-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f sftp-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic sftp-sink -p "sink.connectionHost=The Connection Host" -p "sink.directoryName=The Directory Name"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
