= image:kamelets/replace-field-action.svg[] Replace Field Action

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Replace field with a different key in the message in transit.

The required parameter 'renames' is a comma-separated list of colon-delimited renaming pairs like for example 'foo:bar,abc:xyz' and it represents the field rename mappings.

The optional parameter 'enabled' represents the fields to include. If specified, only the named fields will be included in the resulting message.

The optional parameter 'disabled' represents the fields to exclude. If specified, the listed fields will be excluded from the resulting message. This takes precedence over the 'enabled' parameter.

The default value of 'enabled' parameter is 'all', so all the fields of the payload will be included.

The default value of 'disabled' parameter is 'none', so no fields of the payload will be excluded.

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `replace-field-action`.

=== Knative Action

You can use the `replace-field-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Knative binding.

.replace-field-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: replace-field-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source
    properties:
      message: "Hello"
  steps:
  - ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: replace-field-action
    properties:
      renames: "foo:bar,c1:c2"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel

----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `replace-field-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f replace-field-action-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step replace-field-action -p "step-0.renames=foo:bar,c1:c2" channel:mychannel
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Action

You can use the `replace-field-action` Kamelet as an intermediate step in a Kafka binding.

.replace-field-action-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: replace-field-action-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timer-source

      message: "Hello"
  steps:

      name: replace-field-action
    properties:
      renames: "foo:bar,c1:c2"
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic

----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `replace-field-action-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the action by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f replace-field-action-binding.yaml

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the action by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind timer-source?message=Hello --step replace-field-action -p "step-0.renames=foo:bar,c1:c2" kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
