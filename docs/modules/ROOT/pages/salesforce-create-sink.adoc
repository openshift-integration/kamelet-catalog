.salesforce-create-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: salesforce-create-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: salesforce-create-sink
    properties:
      clientId: "The Consumer Key"
      clientSecret: "The Consumer Secret"
      password: "The Password"
      userName: "The Username"

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `salesforce-create-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f salesforce-create-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel salesforce-create-sink -p "sink.clientId=The Consumer Key" -p "sink.clientSecret=The Consumer Secret" -p "sink.password=The Password" -p "sink.userName=The Username"
