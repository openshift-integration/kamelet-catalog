= image:kamelets/aws-ses-sink.svg[] AWS SES Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send email through the Amazon Simple Email Service (SES).

The basic authentication method for the SES service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.

If you use the default credentials provider, the SES client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.

In the header, you can optionally set the following properties:

- `subject` / `ce-subject` property to specify the email subject. If you do not set this property in the header, the Kamelet uses the exchange ID for the email subject.

- `to` / `ce-to` to provide a comma-separated list of email addresses.

- `reply-to-addresses` / `ce-reply-to-addresses`to provider a comma-separated list of reply-to email addresses.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-ses-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *from {empty}* *| From| From address| string| | `"user@example.com"`
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to access.| string| | 
| accessKey| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| secretKey| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| useDefaultCredentialsProvider| Default Credentials Provider| If true, the SES client loads credentials through a default credentials provider. If false, it uses the basic authentication method (access key and secret key).| boolean| `false`| 
|===

NOTE: Fields marked with an asterisk ({empty}*) are mandatory.


== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-ses-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:core
- camel:aws2-ses
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-ses-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `aws-ses-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-ses-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-ses-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-ses-sink
    properties:
      from: "user@example.com"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-ses-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-ses-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-ses-sink -p "sink.from=user@example.com" -p "sink.region=The AWS Region"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `aws-ses-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-ses-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-ses-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-ses-sink
    properties:
      from: "user@example.com"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-ses-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-ses-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic aws-ses-sink -p "sink.from=user@example.com" -p "sink.region=The AWS Region"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
