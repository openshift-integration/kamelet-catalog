= image:kamelets/aws-cloudwatch-sink.svg[] AWS CloudWatch Metrics Sink

*Provided by: "Red Hat"*

Send data to Amazon CloudWatch metrics.

The basic authentication method for the AWS CloudWatch metrics service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.

If you use the default credentials provider, the CloudWatch client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.

You can set the following properties in the header:

`metric-name` / `ce-metricname` for the metric name.
`metric-value` / `ce-metricvalue` for the metric value.
`metric-unit` / `ce-metricunit` for the metric unit.
`metric-timestamp` / `ce-metrictimestamp` for the metric timestamp.
`metric-dimension-name` / `ce-metricdimensionname` for the dimension name.
`metric-dimension-value` / `ce-metricdimensionvalue` for the dimension value.

== Configuration Options

The following table summarizes the configuration options available for the `aws-cloudwatch-sink` Kamelet:
[width="100%",cols="2,^2,3,^2,^2,^3",options="header"]
|===
| Property| Name| Description| Type| Default| Example
| *cwNamespace {empty}* *| Cloud Watch Namespace| The CloudWatch metric namespace.| string| | 
| *region {empty}* *| AWS Region| The AWS region to access.| string| | 
| accessKey| Access Key| The access key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| overrideEndpoint| Endpoint Overwrite| Select this option to override the endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also provide a URI for the `uriEndpointOverride` option.| boolean| `false`| 
| secretKey| Secret Key| The secret key obtained from AWS.| string| | 
| uriEndpointOverride| Overwrite Endpoint URI| The overriding endpoint URI. To use this option, you must also select the `overrideEndpoint` option.| string| | 
| useDefaultCredentialsProvider| Default Credentials Provider| If true, the CloudWatch client loads credentials through a default credentials provider. If false, it uses the basic authentication method (access key and secret key).| boolean| `false`|

NOTE: Fields marked with an asterisk ({empty}*) are mandatory.


== Dependencies

At runtime, the `aws-cloudwatch-sink` Kamelet relies upon the presence of the following dependencies:

- camel:core
- camel:aws2-cw
- camel:kamelet 

== Usage

This section describes how you can use the `aws-cloudwatch-sink`.

=== Knative Sink

You can use the `aws-cloudwatch-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-cloudwatch-sink
    properties:
      cwNamespace: "The Cloud Watch Namespace"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  
----

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel aws-cloudwatch-sink -p "sink.cwNamespace=The Cloud Watch Namespace" -p "sink.region=The AWS Region"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.

=== Kafka Sink

You can use the `aws-cloudwatch-sink` Kamelet as a Kafka sink by binding it to a Kafka topic.

.aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: KafkaTopic
      apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1
      name: my-topic
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: aws-cloudwatch-sink
    properties:
      cwNamespace: "The Cloud Watch Namespace"
      region: "The AWS Region"
  
----

==== *Prerequisites*

Ensure that you've installed the *AMQ Streams* operator in your OpenShift cluster and created a topic named `my-topic` in the current namespace.
Make also sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f aws-cloudwatch-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta1:KafkaTopic:my-topic aws-cloudwatch-sink -p "sink.cwNamespace=The Cloud Watch Namespace" -p "sink.region=The AWS Region"
----

This command creates the KameletBinding in the current namespace on the cluster.
