=== Knative Sink

You can use the `azure-functions-sink` Kamelet as a Knative sink by binding it to a Knative object.

.azure-functions-sink-binding.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: azure-functions-sink-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref:
      kind: Channel
      apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
      name: mychannel
  sink:
    ref:
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1
      name: azure-functions-sink
    properties:
      url: "https://azure-function-demo-12234.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample"

==== *Prerequisite*

Make sure you have *"Red Hat Integration - Camel K"* installed into the OpenShift cluster you're connected to.

==== *Procedure for using the cluster CLI*

. Save the `azure-functions-sink-binding.yaml` file to your local drive, and then edit it as needed for your configuration.

. Run the sink by using the following command:
+
[source,shell]

oc apply -f azure-functions-sink-binding.yaml
----

==== *Procedure for using the Kamel CLI*

Configure and run the sink by using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
kamel bind channel:mychannel azure-functions-sink -p "sink.url=https://azure-function-demo-12234.azurewebsites.net/api/httpexample"
